# Dungeons and Dragons Character Creator web application
Created by Connor Cole @ ETSU for CSCI-3110

# When Cloning:
  - Run Add-Migration and Update-Database to ensure database is updated

# TO-DO
- Finish XML comments and add comments across board
- Finish character pages
- Prettying up frontend
- Adding an API to not be used because I have to have it but won't use it because its tedious to write javascript when I can just do it in C#

# FINISHED
- Database works
- Data initializer service works; every class/table has data except for Character
- Repo code is (mostly) finished
- Frontend looks better
- Most controllers work!!
- Characters can be written to a PDF
