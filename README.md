# Dungeons and Dragons Character Creator web application
Created by Connor Cole @ ETSU for CSCI-3110

# Features
	- Create characters for Dungeons and Dragons, and have their skills populate automagically based on your class, background, and species choice!
	- Add new spells and equipment
	- Look up information about various things in D&D

# External Frameworks Utilized: 
- Bootstrap, for responsive UI elements
- iText, for PDF generation
- GSAP, for animation on character class index pages

# AI Disclosure
- AI was not used in this project.
  
# User Logins
- Authorization and Authentication were not added to this project. 
- It was originally configured without them, and by the time I realized, I would have had to restart the entire project. I will take those points off.

# When Cloning:
  - Run Add-Migration and Update-Database to ensure database is updated


# FINISHED
- Database works
- Data initializer service works; every class/table has data except for Character
- Characters can be written to a PDF
- API is finished in its entirety
- All pages are finished, not 100% pretty but they work.

# Accessibility
- Images are used sparsely, and those that are in the project have alternative text content to describe them
- Only colors used are black and white, aside from the images in the character class page
- Navigation bar holds all the pages that the user can navigate to
- Content is easy to see across the project
